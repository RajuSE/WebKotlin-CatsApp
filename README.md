# WebKotlin-CatsApp

- Compose Multiplatform is a declarative framework based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that allows you to implement the UI once and 
share it across all the platforms you target. 
- Specifically for web platforms, Compose Multiplatform uses Kotlin/Wasm as its compilation target.
- WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. This format is platform-independent 
because it runs on its own virtual machine. Wasm provides Kotlin and other languages with a compilation target to run on the web.
- Note: Currently, at the time of writing this repo, Kotlin Wasm is Alpha. It may be changed at any time

### How to run?
